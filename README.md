# WELCOME TO BELFAST TENNESSEE
In Episode 2 of Talk Tuah with Haliey Welch, Haliey brings in the people that mean the most to her. She's joined by 3 of her longtime best friends and of course, Granny. Haliey and her friends break down THE NIGHT that changed all of their lives forever- and Granny gives her first reaction to hearing ‘Hawk Tuah’.

Haliey and her friends take us to some of the most important places growing up, as they spill about their ex-boyfriends, a typical night going out, and how they all met. Haliey addresses some of the conspiracy theories around her rise to fame. And Granny gives us the secrets to staying youthful and finding a man.
